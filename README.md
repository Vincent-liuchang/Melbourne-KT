# KT Project1
This is for COMP90049 Project 1.
It contains five java documents.
go, go1, go2, go3 are main methods for the program to calculate results at the same time inorder to save time.
go is for data pre-processing, it will creat a new file called"datapreprocessingresults". Record all the mismatches between correct.txt and misspell.txt and compute pre-processing data.
go1 is the etrance for GED algorithms and creat record for GEO.
go2 is the etrance for 2-Gram algorithms and creat record for 2-Gram.
go3 is the etrance for Soundex algorithms and creat record for Soudex.
Class tools realize all the methods needed for this project.
